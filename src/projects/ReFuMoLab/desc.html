      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The project explores how mobility behavior can be influenced through targeted interventions. 
        At the heart of the project is the TUM campus in Garching, where researchers, students, and industry staff work together to shape a more sustainable transport system. 
        Digital and physical measures—such as an app-based incentive system or automated mini-vehicles—are tested in real-world conditions. 
        The goal is to create a participatory and scalable vision for sustainable campus mobility.</p>

      <p>In close collaboration with campus users, ReFuMoLab develops and trials new mobility services, evaluates their effectiveness, and derives practical insights for broader application. 
        The approach includes digital mobility management, participatory planning formats, and a strong focus on transparency, data collection, and user engagement.</p>

      <h2><strong>Mobility Patterns at Campus Garching</strong></h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Data from the TUM Mobility Survey 2023 shows that the Garching campus accounts for over half (54.6%) of all CO₂ emissions from commuting at TUM, mainly due to a higher share of car use than other locations. 
        Although most students use public transport (79% of trips), car use is still significant among staff (37% of trips). 
        Walking and cycling play only a minor role for most campus users, particularly due to long distances and limited infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Survey participants expressed clear priorities for improving conditions at the campus. 
        The most frequently supported measures include more shopping opportunities (71%), better public transport services (59%), and additional dining options (56%). 
        These results indicate that everyday needs and on-campus convenience are key factors influencing travel behavior.</p>
